/**(Sub)vector of parameters to be treated as a single unit.

Blocks allow the user to create groupings of parameter values.  The individual parameters are still available, but the vector of current
values is also available in <code>ParameterBlock::v</code>.  

The child class `ParameterArray` stores v as an array not a vector, so this allows for a mixture of scalars, vectors, or even arrays.
